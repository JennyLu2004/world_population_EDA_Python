# world_population_EDA_Python
In this project, I explored data about the World Population from year 1980 all the way to 2022. 
I used three packages to perform analysis and visualization for the dataset: pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.pyplot

The steps that I took to perform EDA on my data are: 
- Taking a look at the data and understanding it
- Checking for null values and handling them
- Changing variables to their correct datatypes
- Finding the correlation between variables
- Using sorting, groupby, etc. to derive some insights and visualize those findings
